# bitburner
bitburner script collection


Just copy paste the scripts into your home server and name them the same as i have. then `run rak_hak.ns`

To check how close your servers are to the money threshold do `tail vuln_server.ns` from your home server

The script will attempt to hack all servers and run the vuln_server script on it, it may have issues and be bad code but it works, i think...
